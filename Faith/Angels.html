    <h2>Belief about Angels</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Allah has created Angels out of light and gave them various duties to perform</li>
        <li>They are not visible to us</li>
        <li>They do not commit any sins nor do they disobey Allah</li>
        <li>They do what Allah has ordered</li>
        <li>We do not know their how many angles are there</li>
        <li>We know of four famous Angels. They are:
            <ol>
                <li>Jibraeel</li>
                <li>Mikaeel</li>
                <li>Izraeel</li>
                <li>Israfeel</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    NOTE: As a mark of respect, we say "peace be upon him" (Alaih-as-Salam) with the name of angels
    <h2>Jibraeel</h2>
     Angel Jibraeel brought Allah's Books, Orders and messages to all the Prophets. He was also sent to help the Prophets at times and fight against their enemies
    <h2>Mikaeel</h2>
     Angel Mikaeel is in charge of food and rain. Other angles work under him who are in charge of clouds, the seas, the rivers and the
winds. He gets the order from Allah. He then orders the others under his command
    <h2>Izraeel</h2>
    Angel Izraeel takes away life with the order of Allah. He is in charge of death. Numerous Angels work under him. Some take away the
lives of good persons whilst others looking very fearful take away the lives of sinners and disbelievers
    <h2>Israfeel</h2>
    Angel Israfeel will blow the SOOR (TRUMPET) on the day of judgement. The sound will destroy and kill everything that is on
earth and in the skies. When he blows for the second time all will come
to life with the order of Allah
    <h2>Other well known Angels</h2>
        <h3>Kiraman and Kaatibeen</h3>
        These two angels are always present with every person. One writes all his good deeds and the other writes all his bad deeds
        <h3>Munkar and Nakeer</h3>
        These two angels come to question a person after he dies.
